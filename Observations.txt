Observations:

In the Northern Hemisphere, as the city gets farther away from latititude 0, temperature is colder. This is somewhat true, given that the r-quare is -0.68. The opposite happens in the southern hemisphere with the same level of significance, but towards opposite direction. As the city gets closer to latitude 0, temperature gets warmer.

There is little to none relationship between latitude and humidity. This is likely because elevation plays a role into humidity, as well as other weather factors.

Similar to latitude and humidity, cloudiness has little correlation with latitude. Nonetheless, based on the sample plot, there seems to be more cloudiness percentages concentrated within every 20%
